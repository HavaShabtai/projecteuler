"""
A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from
the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.
Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.
"""
""" 
The structure of the algorithm is as follow:
    1. Create a list of all the numbers that we need to multiply i.e for three
       digit number [100, 101,  ...  , 999]
    2. Filter the list from the unwanted number, who can't create palindromic
       number, e.g 100, 110, 120, ...
    3. Run a for loop on the list to create the wanted multiplication, make
       some more filtration and check if the result is a palindromic number.
    4. Return the maximum.
